      <description>Picking EC2 Spot instances shouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel like rolling dice. Most teams either guess and get bitten by interruptions, or overbuild complicated logic to dodge them.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s the clean split that keeps you sane:&#xA;Spot Optimizer is a Python library/CLI that figures out the right instance types and counts for your workload. EC2 Fleet / Spot Fleet are AWS services that launch and maintain that capacity. Short version: Spot Optimizer decides what to run; EC2/Spot Fleet decide how to run it.</description>

      <description>Docker is a software framework for building, running, and managing containers on servers and the cloud. Here are the several best practices for using Docker in production to improve security, optimize image size and write cleaner and more maintainable Dockerfiles.&#xA;1. Use Official Docker Image as Base Image Always use the official or verified base image when writing the docker file. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are developing a java application and want to build it and run it as a docker image.</description>

      <description>What is GitOps? Treat the infrastructure as code the same way as application code.&#xA;Separate repository for Infrastructure as code. DevOps pipeline. How does GitOps works? Infrastructure as Code hosted on Git repository.&#xA;Version controlled. Team collaboration. Use branching strategy to merge code in git repository. With CI pipeline to test the code. With CD pipeline to apply the changes to the Infrastructure. With the above steps we achieve: Automated Process.</description>

      <description>TL;DR. Code is here.&#xA;Finger detection is an important feature of many computer vision applications. In this application, A histogram based approach is used to separate out the hand from the background frame. Thresholding and Filtering techniques are used for background cancellation to obtain optimum results.&#xA;One of the challenges that I faced in detecting fingers is differentiating a hand from the background and identifying the tip of a finger.</description>
