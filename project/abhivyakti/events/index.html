              The fashion designing cell is one of the most creative cells of SRMGPC. Fashion is a statement, not a style. Fashion does not have to be worn casually, nor outside the runway. Fashion is fit for all sizes for all people of all ages. Fashion is an art of personal self-expression, not an excuse to be pretty, popular and charismatic. We drape fabric and work with colour palettes, enhancing our skills and portraying fashion.

            <p>
              Hospitality refers to the relationship between a guest and his host wherein the host receives the guest with goodwill , including the reception and the entertainment of guest , visitors or strangers. In India Hospitality is based on the principle Atithi  Devo  Bhava , meaning the guest is God. Abhivyakti is an annual fest of SRMCEM.  As we know to make the event successful different cells are required and “Hospitality Cell” is one of those cells. This cell may not be in ‘limelight’ but plays a crucial role. As the name indicates this cell deals with welcoming of the guests and guest of  honour during the whole event. We welcome the guest with open heart so that they make this event more special with their presence.
