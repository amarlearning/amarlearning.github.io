# Movie Trailer Website :movie_camera:


Movie Trailer Website project is the part of my course at Udacity. So Let's give a shortname to this project like 'MTWP' 
and see what's in there.

MTWP is a movie catalog website. Here you will find all the latest and famous movie of all time with there official poster, trailer, storyline, starcast, rating.

As i was learning Python at Udacity so ofcourse this project is made with Python. But there are some other languages also that i have used : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Python.

If you find this movie trailer website a little ugly, then that is because of slow internet connection. The other reason would be because i concentrated more on responsiveness then on design :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
