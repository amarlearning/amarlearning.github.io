Hello, I'm Amar Prakash Pandey :)

I’m a developer, hacker, driven by genuine curiosity, and have an optimistic attitude. I believe that I’m passionate about software development and writing simple, readable code. I love to learn new things and grow. I’ve spent the last 3 years growing as a developer through experience and education.

I prefer to think of myself as an open-minded, down to earth and outgoing person. I care very much for people who I come across in my life and try to make their lives easier. I love nature as well, this is why I like to go on long walks just to see what nature has to show me.

I also like to read about the universe and how it all started. I'm not sure if it's true but I like to think that aliens came from other planets and created us.

I'm currently working as a Solutions Consultant at Sahaj Software. I have also worked for Tata Research Design and Development Center, Tata Consultancy Service, and Google Summer of Code 2017. Open Source Community Member at DuckDuckGo. Maintainer at Open Source Help Community.
