# Hello👋

**who am I?** 

Hi, I'm Amar, currently working as a Solutions Consultant at Sahaj Software in Pune, with a focus on data engineering. I enjoy building and fixing things, particularly when it involves working on large-scale data processing jobs and optimizing Spark workloads.

Over the years, I've worked on various software projects and continuously explore new technologies. I've also contributed as a past maintainer at [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/), [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo.com), and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
