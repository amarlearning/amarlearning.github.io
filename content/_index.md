# Hello👋

**who am I?** 

Hi, I’m Amar — a Data Engineer at Citi in Pune, where I work on building and fixing things, particularly when it involves working on large-scale data processing jobs and optimizing Spark workloads. Before this, I spent four years at Sahaj Software as a Solutions Consultant, solving complex data problems and delivering reliable engineering solutions.

Over the years, I've worked on various software projects and continuously explore new technologies. I've also contributed as a past maintainer at [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/), [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo.com), and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
