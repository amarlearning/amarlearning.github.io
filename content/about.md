Hello, I'm Amar Prakash Pandey :)

I’m a developer and hacker with a knack for solving problems in unconventional ways—finding simpler solutions where conventional methods fall short. Curiosity drives me, and I’m always experimenting with new ideas, whether it’s building efficient software, designing data platforms, or creating tools to make developers’ lives easier. You’ll often find me diving into distributed computing and large-scale data processing while sharing my learnings through open-source contributions and blogs.

I prefer to think of myself as an open-minded, down to earth and outgoing person. I care very much for people who I come across in my life and try to make their lives easier. I love nature as well, this is why I like to go on long walks just to see what nature has to show me.

I also like to read about the universe and how it all started. I'm not sure if it's true but I like to think that aliens came from other planets and created us.

Right now, I’m working as a Solutions Consultant at Sahaj Software, where I focus on data engineering and building optimized, large-scale data processing solutions. I’ve previously worked with Tata Research Design and Development Center, Tata Consultancy Services, and participated in Google Summer of Code. I’m also an Open Source Community Member at DuckDuckGo.
